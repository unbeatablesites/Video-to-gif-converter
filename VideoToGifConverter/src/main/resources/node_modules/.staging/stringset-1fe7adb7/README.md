# stringset.js
A fast and robust stringset implementation that can hold any string items,
including `__proto__`, with minimal overhead compared to a plain object.
Works in node and browsers.

The API is created to be as close to the ES6 Set API as possible. Prefer
`ss.remove("key")` for deleting a key. ES6 Set uses `set.delete("key")`
instead and for that reason `ss['delete']("key")` is available as a
stringset alias as well. Never do `ss.delete("key")` unless you're
certain to be in the land of ES5 or late
