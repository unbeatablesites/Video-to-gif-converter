# stringmap.js
A fast and robust stringmap implementation that can hold any string keys,
including `__proto__`, with minimal overhead compared to a plain object.
Works in node and browsers.

The API is created to be as close to the ES6 Map API as possible. Prefer
`sm.remove("key")` for deleting a key. ES6 Map uses `map.delete("key")`
instead and for that reason `sm['delete']("key")` is available as a
stringmap alias as well. Never do `sm.delete("key")` unless you're
certain to be in the land of ES5 or later
